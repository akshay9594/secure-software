## Projects

In this particular course we designed projects from a security point of view. The programming language used was primarily C++, although we sometimes made use of C as well. We would exchange our projects with an opposition team and would try to find weaknesses and esploits in each others projects. Following are the differe projects we designed in this course.

### Command-Line Minesweeper

This project involved building a clone of the classic Minesweeper game which comes with any Windows PC. One can play the game from the command line and we included different levels for the player to choose from. We had to build this game keeping in mind the SEI CERT C Coding Standards, to make sure we are following all the secure coding standards. Here's the [link]() to the source code of the project.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/akshay9594/secure-software/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
